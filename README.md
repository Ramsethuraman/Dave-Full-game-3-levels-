# Dave-Full-game-3-levels-
This was a casual project which I did during my 12th grade. I made a new game similar to an old game called "Dave". I did not use any library functions except the basic ones. I created 3 levels of the game. This project is completely done in C++ incorporating all concepts such as pointers(Used everywhere), files(used to score high scores), constructors, destructors (Used to initialize 3 lives, score to zero), classes(The code is done using an object oriented, class/struct based design) and many other small concepts.
