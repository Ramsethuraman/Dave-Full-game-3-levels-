# Dave-Full-game-3-levels-
This was a casual project which I did during my 12th grade. I made a new game similar to an old game called "Dave". I did not use any library functions except the basic ones. I created 3 levels of the game. This project is completely done in C++ incorporating all concepts such as pointers(Used everywhere), files(used to score high scores), constructors, destructors (Used to initialize 3 lives, score to zero), classes(The code is done using an object oriented, class/struct based design) and many other small concepts.
I have made my own library file called "Objects.h". This is used to initilize different objects in different places. There are many objects like circular objects, square objects, fire, water, Key to enter the next level, door to enter the next level etc.
The logic which I used mainly comprises of two functions:
a) DAVE: This function is a graphics model of the character called "Dave" in color. So whenever we pass the coordinates to this function and call it, we get the dave figure in those coordinates. (I used graphics.h for graphics in this project)
b)NODAVE:This function is a graphics model of dave which is black in color. I remove all the colors so that "WHEN DAVE MOVES NEXT STEP(+5-x-coordinate, +5-y-coordinate) the OLD COLOR DAVE IS REPLACED BY A BLACK AND WHITE DAVE. Hence we will not have infitite daves as he keeps moving to the next step. 
There are several functions for smaller details.


I HAVE JUST MADE THIS GAME FOR 3 LEVELS. I WILL DO MORE IF YOU GUYS REQUEST FOR IT.
